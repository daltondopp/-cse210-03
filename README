## Jumper
Have you ever found yourself bored and wanting to play hangman but no one will play with you?
Well, this is the program for you!

Jumper is a hangman style game that you can play alone. 
Instead of a traditional hangman, it involves a parachuter who loses his parachute if you lose the game.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 seeker 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
  +-- animation.py              (specific claseses)
